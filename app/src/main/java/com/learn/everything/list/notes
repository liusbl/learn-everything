Things to show (show both hard and basic things):

Show more concrete use cases for ListDiffer. Examlpes include:
    List expansion


tools:listitem=""

usage of inner class

ListDiffer types and usages.
There are many types so therefore there can be confusion

stableId usage

Things you have to remember to do:
- Set layout manager
- inflate with "false" parameter

Difference between
- areItemsTheSame
- areContentsTheSame

Does usage of "lazy" cause a memory leak?

LayoutContainer usage, how to bind views to things

Lists with multiple view holders

Difference between onCreate and onBind with specifici use cases

BE careful when modifying list and setting mutable list,
    it will not work correctly when the same list object is provided
    therefore a list copy is needed.


SHOW:

DiffUtil - Low level class for calculating different between lists
    and dispatching callbacks

ListUpdateCallback - contains possible list modification methods

AsyncListDiffer -

ListAdapter -
